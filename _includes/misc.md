      <strong>Reading:</strong> In my free time, I am an avid reader of fiction, though I have recently started exploring non-fiction as well. My favorite author is Khaled Hosseini. Two books that have left a lasting impact on me are <em>The Fountainhead</em> by Ayn Rand and <em>And the Mountains Echoed</em> by Khaled Hosseini.
